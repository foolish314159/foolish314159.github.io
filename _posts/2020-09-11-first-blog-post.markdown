There is a first time for everything. For me that's writing a blog post right now.

If you were hoping for something interesting to read I have to disappoint you.
Anyway, this is the first time I'm using Github Pages and Jekyll and it seems quite easy to use.

That's all. Hopefully the next post will have some actual content, but knowing myself that's probably going to be 2 years from now.
I like to consider myself a professional at starting new projects but never finishing them.
